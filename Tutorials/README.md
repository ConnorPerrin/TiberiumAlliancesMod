# TiberiumAlliancesMod - Tutorials

So, you've come to this section because you enjoy playing [Tiberium Alliance](http://tiberiumalliances.com/), might have a mod-pack or two installed and you want to create your own mod or two? Well you've come to the right place. This section of the repository is dedicated to giving you a basic understanding of how to create simple mods.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, I'm assuming you have a basic understanding of programming and more specifically the programming language `javascript`. You won't need a lot of knowledge, just a basic understanding. Put bluntly, I won't go into depth into the code or how it works, just how some functions call others from the [Tiberium Alliance API](https://github.com/ConnorPerrin/TiberiumAlliancesMod/tree/main/API).

The last prerequisites is that you first install the plugin [TamperMonkey](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo?hl=en) and take a look at some code (just to get a feel for it).

### TamperMonkey code examples:

Click on the following link to see some [C&C:TA mods](https://www.userscript.zone/search?q=C%26C%3ATA). If you see one you like the look of, click the link then click on the tab that says `code`.
