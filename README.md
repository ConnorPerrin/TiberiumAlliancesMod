# TiberiumAlliancesMod

This repository has been created to help fellow [Tiberium Alliance](http://tiberiumalliances.com/) players create their own mods. Not only will this repository contain helpful API access (The publicly accessible functions) but will also include basic tutorials on how to use it.

## API

To access the currently crawled classes, simply look into the folder name [API](TODO/). In this folder you'll notice a series of sub-folders each with a recognisable naming convention (If you've looked at the code of some other mods before). Please keep in mind that this is not a complete collection of classes and functions.
